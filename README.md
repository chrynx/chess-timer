This is a chess timer that me and my friend needs.
=========================
I can't afford to buy a chess timer so I decided to fix my problem with a project of my own.

This chess timer features:

 - a mobile first approach
 - a simple touch of the screen to de/activate timer
 - changeable color layouts
 - responsive to suit any mobile device
